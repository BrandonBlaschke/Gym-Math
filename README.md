# Gym-Math
This is a web app for a power lifting program. It takes your max weight for a exercise and takes 10% off. 
This is the number that will be used to find your weight for the other percentages. The app helps to cut 
down time typing in values into a calculator. You can use the app [here](https://brandonblaschke.github.io/Gym-Math/).
